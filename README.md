# PsychoBot
Source code for my private Discord Bot.

Use the !commands feature to get a list of available commands for the bot. 
This bot is hosted locally, and is not yet readily available for mass distribution. 
This bot is a fun project that I work on when I get bored, feel free to make any changes as you see fit.
